    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) specializing in AI-enhanced mobile automation, browser, backend
        testing, and CI/CD pipelines. My passion is building intelligent, scalable QA frameworks that speed up feedback
        loops, expand coverage, and deliver exceptional user experiences. I believe AI isn’t just a buzzword but a force
        multiplier for smarter testing and faster releases.</p>

    <p>At Chegg, I engineered and maintained automated frameworks for the Chegg Study mobile apps, leveraging Espresso,
        XCUITest, Appium, and API validation suites to support millions of student users. By integrating these tests
        into CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, I cut regression time by 40%+ and shifted defect detection earlier in the
        development cycle, accelerating delivery without compromising quality.</p>

    <p>Before my work in tech, I led the Oregon western regional operations at FedEx, where I streamlined processes,
        coordinated high-volume logistics, and developed a data-driven approach to problem-solving. That experience
        sharpened my leadership, cross-team collaboration, and process improvement skills, which I now apply to
        engineering projects.</p>

    <p>I thrive where automation meets strategy, combining my background in sociology with my engineering expertise to
        design systems that scale for both the business and the people who use and maintain them. I am passionate about
        creating solutions that reduce friction, improve collaboration, and deliver lasting business value. I am always
        open to connecting on mobile QA, API testing, CI/CD innovation, and practical AI applications in testing.</p>
